##	SED + RegEx
##	===========
##
##	:a;N;$!ba               Append all lines into a single stream
##
##	s/[]\/$*.^|[]/\\&/g     Replace all "special" characters with a version
##	                        with an extra \ in front. But because we can
##	                        just write \, we have to write \\. Finally,
##				& becomes whatever character has ben matched.
##				As for the match, surrounding everything with
##				[] is a wildcard to match any.
##
##	s/[\n\t]$//g		Get rid of very last \n or \t (end of line)
##
##	s/[\n\t]/\\\\\\&/g      Replace any new-line or tab with a version
##	                        with extra dashes in front. These are necesary
##	                        because some get lost when the variable expands
##	                        into subsequent seds.
